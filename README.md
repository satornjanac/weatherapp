### Weather Forecast App

Purpose of this app is to demonstrate how we can configure UI that is shown to the user based on our
response. For this tasked we generated three different responses by using https://designer.mocky.io/ service
Views that user can see on home page are: 
    1. Current weather on the user's location
    2. Hourly weather on the user's location for next 24 hours
    3. 7 days weather on the user's location 

In the mock api these views are called sections and one of the responses look like this:


### Locations

When you install the app, it will ask for permission to access your last known location.
If you allow it to, it will automatically show the weather at your last known location
(it might take some time for it to detect your location). If you don't allow it it wont show anything
